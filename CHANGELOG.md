# 14.0.0

Modified the interface of the object browser to minimize coupling between the presentation and logic layers.

See https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-object-browser#api for the new interface specification.

A new `frost-object-browser-inline` component has also been introduced that implements the `
frost-object-browser` component according to the previously stable 5.x interface and marked the usage
of this component as deprecated for removal in the next major release (15.x).  This allows users of
the legacy format a smoother transition path to the new slots based implementation.

See https://github.com/ciena-frost/ember-frost-object-browser#inline-api for the legacy inline specification.

## Breaking

* **Removed** support for pagination being built into the object-browser

* **Added** support for pagination as a named block slot
  This was done to increase the flexibilty of the object browser.
  The new usage allows for pagination to be passed into the component's block
  section:

  ```handlebars

    filters=filters
    model=model.model
    onCreate=(action 'onCreate')
    onDetailChange=(action 'onDetailChange')

    onFilter=onFilter
    onRowSelect=(action 'onRowSelect')
    title='Resources'
    values=model.visibleResources
    viewSchema=viewSchema
  as |slot|}}
    {{#block-slot slot 'pagination' as |paginator onPageChanged|}}

    {{/block-slot}}
  {{/frost-object-browser}}
  ```

    model=model.model
